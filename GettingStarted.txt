Getting Started with Vimod Pub

What you need to make this process work:
1. Have Java installed on your computer. From: http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp.
2. Ensure that Java is in your %path% variable. 
3. Have a copy of saxon9.jar or saxon9HE.jar on your computer. 
   Contained in Kernow from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/kernowforsaxon
   (Kernow is very useful when you are ready to experiment with xslt transformation.)
   or from: http://saxon.sourceforge.net/
4. Edit the setup-pub\essential_installed.tools file for at least saxon9 variable.
5. For none XSLT transformations you will need to localize setup-pub\user_installed.tools.



When the above is all done.
Open a Command window at the same place as this GettingStarted.txt file.
type 'pub' and press [enter].
Select the appropriate menu item by typing the letter associated with it and pressing [enter].

File structure for projects:
All your files go in a 'project' folder inside a 'group' folder inside the 'data' subfolder .
data\group\project

Where group may be a 'client' or 'iso' code or '2013-08' month or any abitary grouping
depending on how you organize your work. Likewise the 'project' folder can be named 
to suit the overall project. But avoid spaces in path and file names. 
Some things may not work. You are warned. I don't use spaces. So it is untested.
Normally your source files go in the 'project' folder but this is not mandatory.

Your menu and tasks files must go in:
data\group\project\setup

Creating a new Project:
When you create a new folder at the 'group' or 'project' level a new menu item will appear 
automatically based on the name of the folder.

When you make a new Project folder you must make a sub folder called 'setup'.
Within the setup folder you need at least a 'project.menu' file and maybe a yourproject.tasks file.
You can have sub menus started from the 'project.menu'

Menu files and task files have the same format. But some commands do not work at the menu level.

comment or documentation goes before the semicolon   ;command param1 param2
# any line starting with a # is ignored. good for excluding lines temporarily or extra documentation

Here is a simple two line project.menu file:
# project.menu
Transform xml to html              ;tasklist project.tasks

Here is the project.tasks file:
# project.tasks
# lines starting with # are ignored
#
specify the starting file          ;inputfile %projectpath%\books.xml
map xml elements to html           ;xslt generate-match-func2 "defaultelement=span fieldlist='namegroup:div family:div'"
run the transformation             ;xslt generic-html
copy last file to project path     ;outputfile "%projectpath%\familytree.html"

When you run a project:
With in the 'project' folder you created a 'setup' folder. Vimod Pub will create a 'logs'
folder and an 'xml' folder.
'logs' folder contains daily logs that may help you debug if things are not working.
'xml' folder contains the output of each task, named to match the xslt name. There is also
a sequence number and optionally a project code.
i.e. project_code-01-generic-html.xml
