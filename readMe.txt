Various Inputs Mutiple Ouput Digital Publishing

This is a set of files that can fairly quickly create various publishing outputs from one source.

This tool set is aimed at publishers doing digital publishing.

The working format is XML.

Input formats could be XML or XHTML, SFM or other structured inputs.
The outputs could be XHTML, ePub (indirectoy), DictionryForMids, PDF 
(PrinceXML or WkHtmltoPDF, one day maybe FOP), web pages, static page web app, 
Smart phone App content.

No DTD or schema is needed. The XML will most likely need some structure.
