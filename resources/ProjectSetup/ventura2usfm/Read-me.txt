Ventura tagged text to USFM.

This project will take tagged text (after the variables are moddified) and convert 
to XML then process that and output USFM.

It is not a perfect output but failry consistent.

The Paragraph handling is very strong. The inline markup can vary a lot so this is 
where the most work needs to happen ingetting good output.

The source text files are normally placed in the "vp" folder in the project folder.

The separate footnote files need to be named the similarly to the book.
yajhn.txt
yajhnFN.txt

Where FN mars the filea as a footnote.
